Create Server
=============

The commands in this section should be run as root.

To launch a node in the OpenStack CI account (production servers)::

  export OS_CLOUD=openstackci-rax
  export OS_REGION_NAME=DFW
  export FLAVOR="8 GB Performance"
  export FQDN=servername01.opendev.org
  cd /opt/system-config/launch/
  ./launch-node.py $FQDN --flavor "$FLAVOR" \
    --cloud=$OS_CLOUD --region=$OS_REGION_NAME

Manually add the hostname to DNS (the launch script does not do so
automatically, but it prints the commands to run). Note that for
*.opendev.org hosts you'll only be able to add the reverse dns
records via the printed commands. Forward A and AAAA records should
be added to openstack-infra/zone-opendev.org/zones/opendev.org/zone.db.

In order for Ansible to be able to send out the Puppet updates,
you also need the puppetmaster to accept the root SSH key for the
new server. So as root on bridge.openstack.org:

  ssh root@$FQDN

Verify the fingerprint of the new server and type "yes" to accept.
Then you can log out.

Finally we need to add the host to our static inventory file so that
the periodic ansible runs (which can run puppet) see the new host.
Update openstack-infra/system-config/inventory/openstack.yaml to
include the appropriate hostname and IP address details.

Add DNS Records
===============

There are no scripts to automatically handle DNS at the moment due to
a lack of library support for the new Rackspace Cloud DNS (with IPv6).
However, the launch-node script will print the commands needed to be
run to configure DNS for a newly launched server.  To see the commands
for an existing server, run:

  ./dns.py $FQDN
